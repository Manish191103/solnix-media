### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being worked on

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** using our commit message guidelines

5. **Push to your fork**:

   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots (if applicable)
   - Test instructions

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and atomic

- Be responsive to feedback and reviews

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer functional components with hooks

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling

- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles

### File Organization

- Place components in appropriate directories
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) when beneficial
